### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a developer passionate about collecting knowledge, it is a passion of mine to learn new techniques and skills every day, you can say that it is the engine that moves me. For some years I have dedicated myself to Backend development with the Javascript (Node) and Python languages. Currently I am very interested (and studying!) Machine Learning, it is a field for which I have developed a strong interest thanks to my Thesis. At the same time, I am venturing into the field of Front-end Development, because why not? I already said it: I like to learn. At the moment I am learning React!
